## What is this?
* A place to showcase the projects I've worked on, as well as my ongoing progress on my Full Stack Engineering course.
## How was it created?
* Using a bootstrapped theme from startbootstrap.com, then adjusting to my own specs over several versions.
## Key features
* Responsive design
* Portfolio modals
* Smooth scrolling JS
* Single page
## Problems encountered
* Customising the Header div (under my profile image) to remove the bottom padding was difficult as there are many levels of specificity.
* Customising the overall theme colours is a challenge I'm about to embark on (again, lots of complex specificity).
